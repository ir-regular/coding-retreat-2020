### Monad comprehensions

- require `MonadComprehensions` extension
- guards require a monad to implement `MonadPlus`
- grouping requires a monad to implement `MonadGroup`
- parallel comprehensions requires a monad to implement `MonadZip`

Example - note that it does not produce a list:

```haskell
purchaseValueWithDo :: Integer -> Maybe Double
purchaseValueWithDo purchaseId =
  [ fromInteger n * price | n         <- numberItemsByPurchaseId purchaseId
                          , productId <- productIdByPurchaseId purchaseId
                          , price     <- priceByProductId productId ]

-- or convert

[x*y | x <- [-1,1,-2], y <- [1,2,3], then sortWith by x]

-- to

do (x, y) <- sortWith (\(x, y) -> x)
                      (do x <- [-1,1,2], y <- [1,2,3], return (x,y))
   return $ x*y
```

### Combining monads with monad transformers

Packages: `transformers` (core), `mtl` (contains transformers, and also monad
classes; use this over `transformers`)

Monad transformers are not commutative.

> For example, the monad `StateT s []` can represent those nondeterministic
> computations where each of the paths has a different result and a different
> internal state.
> But `ListT (State s)` represents those computations where several results
> can be returned, but the state is shared among all the branches.
>
> `StateT s []` first adds state to the mix, and then results with state are
> wrapped into nondeterminism; whereas `ListT (State s)` first adds
> nondeterminism to the result and then a state to the whole.

Example: take the monad `[()]` (nondeterminism), add extra output `Writer [Int]`
which results in `[Writer [Int] ()]`

```haskell
class MonadTrans t where
  lift :: Monad m => m a -> t m a

-- lift transforms a monad into an "upgraded" context

readerWriterExample :: ReaderT Int (Writer String) Int
readerWriterExample = do x <- ask -- from ReaderT
                         lift . tell $ show x -- tell from writer - requires lifting
                         return $ x + 1

-- you run this by calling: runWriter (runReaderT readerWriterExample 3)
```

Popular monads (monad, transformer, internal representation, after transformation):

```text
Identity: Represents no transformation.
IdentityT
a
m a

[]: Used to represent nondeterminism.
ListT
[a]
m [a]

Maybe: Computations that may fail. Transformer in a separate package MaybeT.
MaybeT
Maybe a
m (Maybe a)

Reader r: A read-only context of type r is available
ReaderT r
r -> a
r -> m a

Writer w: Computation outputs a write-only value of type w, where w must be a Monoid.
WriterT w
(a, w)
m (a, w)

State s: state of type s is kept internally
StateT s
s -> (a, s)
s -> m (a, s)
```

### Monad classes

`MonadReader`, `MonadWriter`, `MonadState` (`MonadLogic` in `logict`)

They enable you to skip explicit calls to `lift`

Eg this will actually work without lifting `tell`:

```haskell
readerWriterExample :: ReaderT Int (Writer String) Int
readerWriterExample = do x <- ask
                         tell $ show x return $ x + 1
```

And you can also use them to make function signature more generic, eg the
above could be rewritten as

```haskell
readerWriterExample :: (MonadReader Int m, MonadWriter String m) => m Int

-- can call with: `runWriter (runReaderT readerWriterExample 3)`
-- can call with `runRWS readerWriterExample 3 0` (0 - state)
```
