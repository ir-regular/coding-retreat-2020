## Haskell: streaming, networking

### Streaming data

To avoid the problem with Haskell being lazy, and having to explicitly
but piecemeal evaluate file contents.

Three popular packages: `pipes`, `io-streams`, and `conduit` - book focuses
on the last one.

`Data.Conduit` module

- `Source` produces values
- `Sink` consumes values
- `Conduit` both produces and consumes; pipe
- `Producer`: Source or Conduit
- `Consumer`: Sink or Conduit

Turns out the book is using a deprecated version of the library, so I'm gonna
read [the docs](https://github.com/snoyberg/conduit) instead.
