Planned: fix blog, publish article

Things did not go as planned. The option to display "previews" on the homepage
doesn't work anymore. I decided to create a "best of" page, but that doesn't
work either! So I spent some time tracking down and
[filing a bug](https://github.com/cryogen-project/cryogen-core/issues/135).
Put a suggested fix in there too, we'll see.

In the meantime I included this fix in my local code, and now I finally have
a reasonably-looking and useful homepage. Now working on a better 404.
