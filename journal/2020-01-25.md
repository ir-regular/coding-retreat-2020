Planned: Modern C, finish challenge 18

## C threads, Posix threads

Here's a nice mapping of thread functions as they appear in the book vs
pthreads.

## Challenge 18

Wrote code. Found bugs. Fixed bugs. Realised sorting functions may be (?)
thread-unsafe.

Problem is, I cannot quickly find a good description of how to use
`pthread_key_*` functions, _and_ I never intended to get into threading
in C anyway. _And_ I'm really tired of handling Special Cases; for the first
time working on a Mac feels like working on Windows, except I have iterm.

In short, I'm pulling the plug on challenge 18 early. I'm reasonably sure
that if I got myself "Programming with POSIX Threads" or some such, I'd
get this done, and that's enough for now.
