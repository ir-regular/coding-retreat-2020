Planned: writing up notes in an article.

Actually: leftover from yesterday, since I have an unidentified memory leak
(lol) and I can't seem to get debugging working well.

## C, oy oy.

Continuing debugging:

`clang -Wall -Werror -o output.out mc_gen.c mc_sort.c challenge_1_2.c -g -fsanitize=address`

then run one of those and see if you can identify anything:

- `./output.out`
- `ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-symbolizer ./output.out`
- `PATH=/usr/bin /usr/bin/lldb`

(To get `llvm-symbolizer` you need to `brew install llvm` first)

Challenge 14 - refactoring sorting algorithms from 1 (reused in 10) to be more
generic, finished. 

Did not get around to making more detailed notes from part 2. Honestly,
the biggest problem for me at the moment is tooling, or more specifically:
how do I debug effectively? This is what JetBrains IDEs are great at,
but ... yeah, no CLion. I will have to try VS Code tomorrow.

### Pointer pains

Converting things from arrays to void pointers is painful, because void pointers
lose the automatic type information, so you have to multiply everything by size.
Also, you can't do pointer arithmetic on void pointers, so you have to cast
them to `unsigned char *`
