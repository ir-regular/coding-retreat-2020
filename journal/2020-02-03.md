### Filter-like functions accepting predicates

- `partition` - split a list into a tuple of two, based on a predicate
- `find` - get the first element that satisfies a predicate
- `dropWhile` - returns a lazy sequence starting with the first element that satisfies predicate
- `takeWhile` - returns a lazy sequence of all initial elements that satisfy predicate
- `span` - returns a tuple of `takeWhile` and the other elements which would normally be dropped
- `any` - global `or` - returns true if at least one element satisfies predicate
- `all` - global `and` - returns true if all elements satisfy predicate 

### Set-like functions (require Eq)

- `elem` - contains? x xs
- `union` - set union
- `intersect` - set intersection
- `(\\)` - set difference
- `nub` - remove duplicates using `==`, v. inefficient
- `delete` - remove first occurence of the element

### Set-like functions accepting custom comparators

- `unionBy` - set union using custom comparator
- `intersectBy` - set intersection using custom comparator
- `insertBy` - adds one element to set if not exists, using custom comparator
- `nubBy` - remove duplicates using a custom comparator, v. inefficient
- `groupBy` - groups following items using a custom comparator

- `on` from module `Data.Function` - apply a unary function to two arguments,
    then compare them with a comparator; useful for extracting properties
    from records
    
```haskell
sortBy (compare `on` someField) listOfRecords
```

### Ordered list functions

Ordering in Haskell is defined by returning an `Ordering` value,
which can be `LT`, `EQ`, or `GT`.

- `insert` - adds one element at the first position where it is less than
    or equal to the next element (requires Ord)
- `sort` - order elements (requires Ord)
- `compare` - returns `Ordering` based on comparing two elements (requires Ord)
    and automatically implies `(>)`, `(<)`, `(>=)`, and `(<=)`

### Data.Maybe so useful!

- `listToMaybe` - maybe constructor, `listToMaybe [] = Nothing; listToMaybe (x:xs) = Just x`
- `maybeToList` - list constructor, `maybeToList Nothing = []; maybeToList Just x = [x]`
- `isJust` - predicate, true if Just
- `isNothing` - predicate, true if Nothing
- `catMaybes` - collect all Just values
- `mapMaybes` - (map+filter): map a function over values, filter out Nothing results, unwrap Just results
- `fromMaybe` - unwraps Just; converts Nothing to default
- `maybe` - unwraps Just and applies a function to it; converts Nothing to default

### List comprehensions

- `[1 ..]` - list with all elements larger than 1 (can be infinite)
- `[1 .. n]` - range, n-inclusive
- `[ expression | qualifier, qualifier... ]` where a qualifier may be one of:
    - generator: `element <- list` where `element` can be a pattern match
    - binding: `let bound_var = expression`
    - guard: (call to predicate)
    
Extension: `TransformListComp`; more qualifiers
    - transform with function: `then f` where `f :: [a] -> [a]`
    - transform with expression: `then f by e` (eg. `then sortWith by x`)
    - `then group by e using f` where  `f :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [[a]]`

Extension: `ParallelListComp`; rather than imitating nested iterations over
    generators, it advances all generators at the same time (like `zip`).

Functions useful for comprehensions, from module `GHC.Exts`
    - `the`
    - `sortWith`
    - `groupWith`

### Haskell Origami - folds and unfolds

Folds are very powerful. _Well, obviously,_ since they are loops with optional state.

There exist `unfold` functions in `Data.List`.

`unfoldr :: (b -> Maybe (a, b)) -> b -> [a]`

Which is `take-while some? (iterate f x)`

### Pragmas

- `TransformListComp` - grouping and sorting for list comprehensions
- `ParallelListComp` - parallel comprehension
