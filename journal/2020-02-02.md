## Haskell refresher

### ghci - how to use

1. go to root code directory (`src`)
2. run `ghci`

- multi-line block inside the interpreter: `:{` ... `:}`
- `:t thing` for type of the thing
- `:l ParentModule/Module.hs` to load `ParentModule.Module`
- running it in `src` means imports of project files will work correctly
    (they're treated as relative to cwd) 

### Code reuse options

As identified by the book:

- parametric polymorphism (aka templates, generics; example: `head`)
- higher-order functions (example: `map`, `foldl`)
- exporting / importing funcitons between modules

### Parametric polymorphism

When you introduce a parameter into function signature, a data type, or a type.

Examples:

- `maybeString :: Maybe t -> String`
- `data Client i = GovOrg { clientId :: i} | Company { clientId :: i }`
    or `data SamePair a = SamePair a a` (if two fields had the same type)

### Higher-order functions

- `map`

Anonymous function syntax: `(\x -> expr_with_x)` or `(\(x,y,...) -> expr_with_x_y)`
and the backslash is meant to resemble lambda.

Functions can be returned as values, eg. how to produce a closure: `multiplyByN n = \x -> n*x`

Partial application is possible (as indicated by function signatures): `double = map (*2)`

> at its core, every function with more than one parameter is just a function that takes
> one parameter and returns a closure with one parameter less

### Importing and exporting

Modules are hierarchical. However, importing `ParentModule` will not import its
`ParentModule.ChildModule` or any definitions from the latter.

In order to avoid name clashes, you need to control what you import and
know how to alias or prefix the names:

- `import SomeModule hiding (fn1, fn2)` - import everything except fn1, fn2
- `import SomeModule (SomeDataType())` - import type, no constructors
- `import SomeModule (SomeDataType(SomeConstructor,OtherConstructor))` - import type, 2 constructors
- `import SomeModule (SomeDataType(..))` - import type, all constructors
- `import qualified SomeModule (fn1, fn2)` - import functions prefixed with module
    that is `SomeModule.fn1`, `SomeModule.fn2`
- `import qualified SomeModule as S` - import all functions prefixed with alias `S`

You can also select which definitions from your module are available for import
elsewhere (this is called exporting): `module SomeModule (SomeDataType(), someFn)`

#### Smart constructors

Basically, factories, but reinvented. *MMMMAGIC*

Sometimes you can't express all the necessary constraints in a data type with
just the type system. Perhaps you want to say "only positive integers."
This is what you do...

1. Export the problematic data type with no constructors
2. Export a function which runs additional checks on arguments before
    running the appropriate constructor; it throws an error if arg invalid
    (this is the smart constructor; basically a Factory, where the data type
    acts as the overall interface.) 
3. Export a second data type with a constructor: it acts as a set of public
    accessors, which means you can pattern-match on it
4. Export a method converting 1 (problematic data type) to 2 (public accessor
    data type)
    
So basically:

1. An opaque `Thing` interface with no getters
2. A `thing_factory` function that returns an object implementing that interface
3. A `thing_to_public_thing` function converting that interface into
    a `PublicThing`-class object with all properties public;
    equivalent of `to_array` or something

You achieve the equivalent of "private" field access by not exporting it out
of the module.

**I'M FROTHING**

### More basic functions and operators

- `succ` - `inc`, `++`

When you're partial-applying an infix operator, order differs:

- `map (/2) [1,2,3]` - divide ... by two
- `map (2/) [1,2,3]` - divide two by ...

### Combinators

#### `$` function application.

`f $ a = f a` - however it also:

- binds to the right (normal function application binds to the left)
- very low precedence (normal function application has the highest precedence possible)

> you usually see it used instead of parentheses to associate things that otherwise wouldnâ€™t. 
 
Which means chaining function calls like: `maximum $ map succ [1, 2, 3]`
instead of `maximum (map succ [1, 2, 3])`

#### `.` function composition

The rightmost function is applied to the argument, the leftmost function
is applied to the result of the former.

`f . g = \x -> f (g x)`

It is used in "point-free style". The point-free style encourages
the use of (.), and discourages explicit parameters. Example:

`duplicateOdds = map (*2) . filter odd`

As an example of using both operators. Since normal function application
has higher precedence than function composition,
you can use `$` to lower it and apply composed functions without brackets:
`head . sort $ "julie"` 

- this is valid: `head . sort $ "julie"`
- this is also valid: `head $ sort "julie"`

#### curry and uncurry

`curry`: convert a function from single-argument (tuple) to multi-argument

Usecase: you can partially-apply a curried function.

```haskell
curry :: ((a,b) -> c) -> a -> b -> c
curry f = \x y -> f (x,y)
```

`uncurry`: convert a function from multi-argument to single-argument (tuple)

Usecase: you can apply an uncurried function through a higher-order function
(`map`, `filter` etc) to a sequence of tuples.

```haskell
uncurry :: (a -> b -> c) -> (a,b) -> c
uncurry f = \(x,y) -> f x y

map (uncurry max) [(1,2),(2,1),(3,4)]
```

#### flip

`flip` reverses the order of parameters in a function.

Usecase: this'd be wonderful for all those moments in Clojure when you need
to switch between `->` and `->>`

`flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> (b -> a -> c)`

#### folds, aka reduce

- `foldr` applies function to _last_ element & initial value, recurses until the entire list is reduced
- `foldr1` is like `foldr` except uses _last_ element instead of initial value
- `foldl` applies function to _first_ element & initial value, recurses until the entire list is reduced
- `foldl1` is like `foldl` except uses _first_ element instead of initial value

### Pragmas

- `LambdaCase` - anonymous functions use `(\case ...)` to enable pattern matching
- `ExplicitForAll` - to be able to write explicit foralls
- `RankNTypes` - implies explicit foralls
- `NoImplicitPrelude` - disable automatic import of Prelude
