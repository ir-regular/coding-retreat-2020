Planned: evaluate source languages for compilation

## Oberon

### Why Oberon?

- simple grammar, so I don't have to spend too much time doing
    parsing/lexing which are the part that interests me least atm
    (Wirth championed compiler simplicity)
- designed to be compiled in a single pass
- little known, but not a complete joke language (honestly, who's excited about
    writing a shittier clone of something that already exists?)
    - no, really, there's even a [Brainfuck to Wasm compiler](https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs#brainfuck)
- proof by authority (had a lecturer who was a _big_ fan, and that lecturer
    was not stupid)
- no advanced features, so I might be able to implement the whole language

### Why not Oberon?

- I don't know it at all
- I'm never going to use it again after this
- not exciting anymore
- no strong community
- people don't use it for real-life projects
- very few tools for building it, so diffs for automated tests are hard to create
- I'm gonna use bison anyway, so grammar might not be as much of a problem

## Haskell

### Why Haskell?

- I might actually use it in future
- I like it
- it's cool

### Why not Haskell?

- there's a well-funded effort to write a wasm compiler anyway
- core language has been heavily extended but that's not formalized
- I don't actually know it all that well
- I'm honestly not sure if I can write a reasonable compiler in C
    that can handle Haskell's typing system in a reasonable length of time

## Ocaml

### Why Ocaml?

- I might actually use it in future
- there's no project for Ocaml -> WebAssembly at the moment
- proof by authority: I know smart people who use it right now
- I have used ML family languages before, and they were okay

### Why not Ocaml?

- I don't know Ocaml _at all_
- complicated features, urgh
- Type inference

## And then I got annoyed

OR ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WHAT I COULD DO

I COULD HAVE SOME ACTUAL FUN AND WRITE A C COMPILER IN OCAML

YEAH

So now I'm learning _another_ new language because why not ðŸ¤˜

Except I got lazy, started with exercism and did not particularly think about
learning tracks, saving the results in the project, etc, so I'm going to have
to make up for it tomorrow.
