## Haskell refresher, cont'd

### Enabling profiling

Build via `stack build --profile`

Run via `stack exec --profile -- beginning-haskell +RTS -p`

After `+RTS` put one of these options:

- `-p` for time profiling
- `-h` for memory profiling by cost centres 
- `-hy` for memory profiling by types

See: https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/flags.html#profiling-options

Resulting in files:

- `./beginning-haskell.prof` - time profile (text file)
- `./beginning-haskell.hp` - memory profile
    - `hp2ps beginning-haskell.hp` will produce a PostScript file that can then be viewed

### Forcing evaluation, cont'd

_Strict field_: marked by `!` prefix. Expressions in the strict positions will
be forced to evaluate in the same fashion as if you had included an explicit `seq`.

_Unpacked field_: stored as value, rather than as reference to a value.
This is more memory-efficient. Declared via `{-# UNPACK #-}` GHC annotation.
It is only possible if the field is of a basic type, or if the type has only
one constructor and all fields are unpacked. _Not_ possible to unpack a list
(so `String` doesn't work.)

```haskell
data Client = GovOrg {-# UNPACK #-} !Int String
            | Company {-# UNPACK #-} !Int String Person String
            | Individual {-# UNPACK #-} !Int Person
            deriving Show
```

Packages like `Data.Map` provide lazy and strict implementations - and they use
lazy by default.

`deepseq` and `($!!)` work like `seq` and `($!)` but force subexpressions.
