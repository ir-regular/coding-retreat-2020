## Haskell: classic IO, randomness, exceptions

Useful libraries:

- `haskeline` - for command line applications
- `random` - for rng
- `conduit` - for streaming
- `cereal`

For unfolding on monads, `Control.Monad.Loop` - in package `monad-loops`

### Classic (lazy) I/O

`IO` monad - there is no safe way to convert `IO t` into `t` - the unsafe ways
are used for interop.

```haskell
module Main where

main :: IO()
```

Output:

- `putStrLn`
- `putChar`
- `print`

These functions have return type `IO ()`, using unit type `()`,
similar to `tell` (from Writer) and `put` (from State)

Input:

- `getLine` (get a line from input on enter: return type `IO String`)
- `getChar` (character by character)
- `getContents` (get the whole stream until EOF)

Useful:

- `hSetBuffering stdout LineBuffering` (flush buffer after every line)

### File I/O (where problems with laziness show up)

Haskell is lazy, and might eg. evaluates reads from file only when they are
needed (eg to print), which can be long after the file has been closed.
You have to force the value read with `seq` or `deepseq`.

Prelude, basic functions (inefficient):

- `writeFile`
- `appendFile`
- `readFile`

module: `System.IO`, more complete control (where `FilePath` is synonym for `String`):

- `openFile`
- predefined handles: `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`
- `hClose` - close file handle
- read/write to file handle: `hGetChar`, `hGetLine`, `hGetContents`, `hPutChar`, `hPutStr`, `hPutStrLn`
- are you finished reading file: `hIsEOF`
- `hSetEncoding` - change encoding of a file handle (`latin1`, `utf8`, `utf16`, `utf32`)

#### CLI, quick look (there will be more)

module: `System.Environment`

- `getArgs`
- `withFile` - automatically opens and closes file, eg. `withFile inFile ReadMode $ \inHandle ->` etc

### Filesystem

module: `System.Directory`

- `renameFile`, `copyFile`, `removeFile`
- `getDirectoryContents`
- `createDirectory` (fails if parents not present; or if dir exists)
- `createDirectoryIfMissing` (tolerant of filepath missing and dir existing)
- `renameDirectory` (again, fails if dir exists)
- `removeDirectory`, `removeDirectoryRecursive`

library: `filepath`, module: `System.FilePath`
 
- `</>` - interoperable filepath separator operator
- `splitFileName` - split into directory and filename
- `<.>` - extension separator operator
- `splitExtensions` - tuple of file name, and all extensions

And many more

### Randomness

`System.Random`

- `randomRIO` requires `IO` monad (because it updates RNG)
- `randomR` if you provide it with a `StdGen`, doesn't require a monad
- `mkStdGen` to create a `StdGen` value with a fixed seed
- `getStdGen` get the global `StdGen` value

### Error handling

Imprecise: `Maybe`. Better: `Either`.

> Conventionally, the usage of `Either` for errors uses `Right` when
> the computation is successful, and `Left` for failing scenarios

Example: 

```haskell
companyName :: Client i -> Either CompanyNameError String

printCompanyName :: Client i-> IO ()
printCompanyName c = case companyName c of
                       Right n -> putStrLn n
                       Left GovOrgArgument     -> putStrLn "A government organization was given"
                       Left IndividualArgument -> putStrLn "An individual was given"
```
`errors` package, `Control.Error.Util` module for Maybe/Either conversion:

- `hush :: Either a b -> Maybe b`
- `note :: a -> Maybe b -> Either a b`

- `MonadError` type class: a `MonadPlus` which works both on Maybe and Either.
- `ErrorT` monad transformer (asks for an error of `Error` type class; interop with monad's `fail` function)

`either` package

- `EitherT` monad transformer
- `hushT :: Monad m => EitherT a m b -> MaybeT m b`
- `noteT :: Monad m => a -> MaybeT m b -> EitherT a m b`

```haskell
class Monad m => MonadError e m | m -> e where
  throwError :: e -> m a
  catchError :: m a -> (e -> m a) -> m a
```

Example use:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}
import Control.Monad.Error

companyName :: MonadError CompanyNameError m => Client i -> m String
companyName Company { clientName = n } = return n
companyName GovOrg { }                 = throwError GovOrgArgument
companyName Individual { }             = throwError IndividualArgument

companyNameDef :: MonadError CompanyNameError m => Client i -> m String
companyNameDef c = companyName c `catchError` (\_ -> return "")
```

### Workarounds around historically unsafe functions

`safe` package (eg. `head` -> `headMay`, `headDef`)

### Exceptions

- pure errors: thrown and caught anywhere
- exceptions: thrown anywhere, caught only inside an IO context

`Either` requires enumerating all possible failure modes upfront; exceptions
are extensible, but make code analysis less clear.

#### Definitions

Root exception type: `SomeException`

`System.IO.Error` - contains `IOException`

- `isDoesNotExistError` - check whether the exception was due to "file does not exist"

`Control.Exception` - exceptions raised by the platform

- `ArithException`
- `ErrorCall`
- `PatternMatchFail`

In order to use a type you defined as an exception, you need to create instances
for it of the `Show`, `Typeable`, and `Exception` type classes. 

```haskell
data AuthenticationException = UnknownUserName String
                             | PasswordMismatch String
                             | NotEnoughRights String
                             deriving (Show, Typeable)

instance Exception AuthenticationException

main = do throw $ UnknownUserName "Alejandro"
          `catch` (\(e :: AuthenticationException) -> ...)
```

#### Throwing

Reuse predefined exceptions:

- `throwIO` from inside IO monad
- `throw` from pure code

```haskell
main = do throw $ NoMethodError "I don't know what to do"
          `catch` (\(e :: SomeException) -> do putStr "An exception was thrown: "
                                               putStrLn $ show e)
```

#### Catching

`Control.Exception` module; requires `ScopedTypeVariables` GHC extension.

Options:

- `catch`: handle a specific exception class
- `catchJust`
- `catches`: define multiple `Handler`s
- `handle`: define a handler pre-emptively
- `handleJust`
- `try`: returns caught exception in Left, computation value in Right
- `tryJust`

"...Just" versions  take as extra parameter an exception filter, which decides
whether a particular exception should be caught by that handler or rethrown.

Also, `exceptions` package with `MonadCatch`

```haskell
-- code that may throw
`catch` (\(e :: IOException) -> -- handler body

-- code that may throw
`catches` [ Handler (\(_ :: ErrorCall) -> putStrLn "Error reading number")
          , Handler (\(e :: ArithException) -> case e of ...)]

main = handle (\(_ :: ErrorCall) -> ...) $
       handle (\(e :: ArithException) -> ...) $
       -- code that may throw  

main = catchJust (\e -> if e == DivideByZero then Just e else Nothing)
        ( ... code ... )
        (\_ -> putStrLn "Division by zero")
```

#### Cleanup

`Control.Exception` module; requires `ScopedTypeVariables` GHC extension.

- `finally` will definitely run even if some exception arose on the way
- `bracket` (acquisition, release, and body)
