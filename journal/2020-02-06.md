## Beginning Haskell, cont'd - laziness

TODO: look up a better explanation of:

- how thunks work
- what irrefutable patterns do

### Lazy functions (pretty much everything I guess?)

- `repeat x` - generate an infinite sequence of [x, x, x, ...]
- `cycle xs` - generate an infinite sequence of xs ++ xs ++ ...
- `iterate f x` - generate an infinite sequence of [f x, f (f x), f (f (f x)), ...]
- `take n l` - take first n elements of a list
- `find p l` - find the first element fulfilling the predicate
- `zip l1 l2` - stops when one of the lists ends
- `head` - head of a sequence

> _irrefutable pattern_ - matching upon it never fails, but itâ€™s only
> destructured when some of its constituent parts are needed

`undefined` (or `undefined :: a` typed `a`) means a computation that won't end.
It can be used as a placeholder instead of code that is not yet written
for purposes of type checking.

A function is strict on its argument if `f undefined = undefined`

### Forcing evaluation

- `foldl'` forces evaluation before continuing
- `seq` forces evaluation of the first arg before second
- `$!` strict application (forces evaluation of function arguments)
- `deepseq`

```haskell
a `seq` b  -- forces evaluation of a before b, usually a is part of b

-- you can transform...
x `seq` f x
-- ...into
f $! x

-- if you enable BangPatterns you can also force evaluation of parts of patterns

sumYears :: [TimeMachine] -> Integer
sumYears xs = sumYears' xs 0
              where sumYears' [] z = z
                    sumYears' (TM _ !y :ys) z = let !s = z + y in sumYears' ys s
```

### GHC extensions

- `BangPatterns` allows forcing the evaluation of some parts of the pattern
