### Lenses

A different way to query and update Haskell data structures.

Every time you have a well-defined way to get and return values, you can
generate a lens.

Multiple lens libraries available:

- `lens` (covered by the book)
- `fclabels`
- `data-accessor`
- `data-lens`

How to use a lens:

Simple Lens: write getters and setters by hand - useful when the structure
doesn't change after update.

```haskell
firstName :: Lens' Person String
firstName = lens (\(Person f _) -> f)
                 (\(Person _ l) newF -> Person newF l)
```

Full Lens: when the type of resulting structure changes.
