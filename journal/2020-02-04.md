## Haskell, cont'd

The book advises you to install `cabal-dev`, but it doesn't work - according
to the issues in the project, you're just meant to use `cabal sandbox`. Ok?

Do not run `cabal install`, despite what the book tells you. There is no
option to `uninstall`. You're gonna have globally-installed packages you
can't remove.

Should have Googled: [the author now recommends stack](https://www.47deg.com/blog/setting-up-haskell/).

NOTE: You may need to run 'xcode-select --install' and/or
      'open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg'
      to set up the Xcode command-line tools, which Stack uses.

### Keywords and operators

- `type` - create a type synonym, makes type equivalent to its definition
- `newtype` - creates a new type, which is not equivalent to its definition
- `:: Person` - cast to a specific type

Example:

```haskell
type Predicate a = a -> Bool

filter :: Predicate a -> [a] -> [a]
```

### Ad-hoc polymorphism

type class: declaration of a set of functions along with their types.

When applied to function signature they appear here:

`function :: ClassName v => (actual signature using v)`

Class declaration:

```haskell
class ClassName variable => SuperClass variable where
    someFunction :: SomeFunctionType
    -- ...
    anotherFunction :: AnotherFunctionType

    -- ...this can also contain default function definitions! 
```

Instance declaration:

```haskell
instance ClassName Type where
    someFunction = ...
    anotherFunction = ...
```

And if type has a variable, you may need to do this:

```haskell
instance (Class v) => Class (Type v) where
    ...
```

`import Module ()` - may be importing instace declarations

`deriving` - automatically instantiates given classes

Some built in type classes:

- `Eq`
- `Ord`
- `Show`
- `Read`
- `Num` - + - * negate abs signum fromInteger
- `Real` - (eg. Integer) toRational
- `Integral` - supports integer division, modulus. quot, rem, quotRem, div, mod, divMod 
- `Fractional` - / recip fromRational
- `Floating` - pi, e, sqrt, log, exp, ** etc

### More list functions

- `map f xs` - applies f to every x in list, returns a list of results 
- `concat xs` - `x ++ x ++ ... ++ x`
- `concatMap` - Clojure `mapcat` :) 

### Container: Data.Map

More efficient variants:

- `containers`: `IntMap` for integer keys
- `unordered-containers`: `HashMap` for hashable keys

Predicates:

- `null m` - predicate: is the map empty?
- `member k m` - is the key available in the map?

Constructors:

- `empty` - new empty map
- `singleton k v` - new map with one elmement
- `fromList [(k,v)]` - new map from list of key-value pairs

Deconstructors:

- `assocs` - convert map to a list of key-value pairs

Getters:

- `lookup k m` - returns `Maybe value`
- `findWithDefault v k m` - returns `v` if `k` not a member
- `findMin`
- `findMax`
- `deleteMin`
- `deleteMax`
- `updateMin`
- `updateMax`

Setters:

- `insert k v m` - add new k/v pair (or overwrite previous value for the key)
- `insertWith f k v m` - combine old value and new value for the same key (merge fun receives values)
- `insertWithKey f k v m` - combine old value and new value for the same key (merge fun receives values and key)
- `delete k m` - unset key
- `adjust f k m` - update value using function, if exists
- `alter f k m` - where `f :: Maybe a -> Maybe a` if receives Nothing, the key
    was not found; if returns Nothing, the key is dropped

Iterators:

- `map`
- `foldr`
- `foldl`
- `filter`
- `partition`

> each time that a function will be called with a value of the map, there's
> an alternative function ending in WithKey that also gives the key
> to the function

### Container: Data.Set

More efficient variants:

- `containers`: `IntSet` for integer keys
- `unordered-containers`: `HashSet` for hashable keys

Predicates

- `null`
- `member`

Constructors

- `empty`
- `singleton e`
- `fromList [e]`

Deconstructors

- `toList`

Setters

- `insert e s`

Set functions

- `intersect`

Iterators

- `map` (unordered; duplicates compressed to one element)

### Trees, Data.Tree

More efficient variants: `TreeStructures`, `AvlTree` or `RBTree` in Hackage.

- `flatten`
- `levels`
- `Data.Foldable.fmap`
- `Data.Foldable.foldr`

### Graphs, Data.Graph

Directed, unweighed graph, with edges modelled as [key -> list of connected keys]

constructors

```haskell
graphFromEdges :: (Ord key) => (node, key, [key])
                            -> (Graph,
                                -- vertex to node and keys
                                Vertex -> (node, key, [key]),
                                --  key to vertex, if exists
                                key -> Maybe Vertex)

-- if graph already consists of integers:
-- Bounds: tuple (min_id, max_id)
-- Edge: (start_id, end_id)

-- note: the library creates vertices for all identifiers in between Bounds!!
buildG :: Bounds -> [Edge] -> Graph
```

getters

- `vertices`
- `edges`

graph movement

- `topSort` - topological sort (returns a list of (node, key, [key]) tuples)
- `path v1 v2` - path between two vertices
- `reachable v` - which vertices are reachable from a given vertex
- `scc` - strongly connected components; partitions the graph in such a way
    that in one component you can travel from every vertex to every other vertex
    for a graph built by buildG
- `stronglyConnComp` - for a graph built by graphFromEdges
- `flattenSCC` - print output of `stronglyConnComp`
