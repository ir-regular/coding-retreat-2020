## Haskell, cont'd

### Some notes on code style

Align commas with braces when defining record fields:

```haskell
type Company = Company { clientRName :: String
                       , companyId :: Integer
                       , person :: PersonR
                       , duty :: String
                       }
```

Hanging lambdas, common when using function combinators:

```haskell
purchaseValue :: Integer -> Maybe Double
purchaseValue purchaseId =
  numberItemsByPurchaseId purchaseId `thenDo` (\n ->
    productIdByPurchaseId purchaseId `thenDo` (\productId ->
    priceByProductId productId       `thenDo` (\price ->
    Just $ fromInteger n * price     )))
```

Also, for example: https://memo.barrucadu.co.uk/haskell-style-guide.html

Also: `cabal install hlint` (outside of a haskell project)

### Types, cont'd

Unit type: `()` (unit type means that there's only one element of this type.)
Convention: return this when a function needs a return value, but you have no
relevant return value. (Kind of `_` for return, isn't it?)

### MONADS YAY!

Basically promise chaining; only continue on successful value:

```haskell
thenDo :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
thenDo Nothing  _ = Nothing
thenDo (Just x) f = f x
```

What if we wanted to chain functions passing state in addition to arg(s)?

```haskell
thenDo :: (a,s) -> (a -> s -> (b,s)) -> (b,s)
```

What if we wanted the above, but (...generators? not clearly explained why
this is useful.)

```haskell
type State s a = s -> (a, s)

-- note similarity to the Maybe-based function
thenDo :: State s a -> (a -> State s b) -> State s b
-- which is, when unwrapped:
-- thenDo :: (s -> (a,s)) -> (a -> s -> (b,s)) -> (s -> (b,s))

-- v2:
-- thenDo f g s = let (resultOfF, stateAfterF) = f s
--                in g resultOfF stateAfterF

-- v3:
-- thenDo f g s = ((uncurry g) . f) s
-- or if you want to make it terser and less intelligible: 
thenDo f g = uncurry g . f
```

```haskell
class Monad m where
  return :: a -> m a
  (>>=)  :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
  (>>)   :: m a -> m b -> m b
  f >> g = f >>= (\_ -> g)

  fail   :: String -> m a
  fail s = error s
```

I don't feel like I understood this well, so I'm gonna read
[this](https://mvanier.livejournal.com/3917.html) and come back to the book
to review the code changes.
