Planned: how do you set up a C project?

Over the last two days, more things didn't go as planned. However, the blog is
now up, and I have contacted some beta-readers for the post.
Time to go back to C!

One thing I noticed is that I'm struggling without the non-language related
knowledge. I thought I would be able to avoid this, since I'm not building
a library-based project, but it would still be useful to know:
 
- An IDE with code highlighting, completion, refactoring, formatting
- How do you set up a project?
- How do you build a project?
- How do you test your code?
- How do you debug your code?

So I guess I will spend today on researching developer environment and project
setup.

## IDE options

My preferred option would be CLion, but... etc etc. I don't feel like fixing
the plugin for IDEA. So it's either [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
or [xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

VS Code first impressions:

- input delay - It. Feels. Slow. Like I have a mushy keyboard. Except I know for a fact I don't
    have a mushy keyboard, because Jetbrains IDEs don't feel mushy. JAVA IS FASTER THAN THIS
- very good tutorial, copy-pasta "just works" (modulo I know a couple of clang options already,
    and the tutorial is set up for C++)
- debugging works, I can set up breakpoints and watchpoints. Pointer conversion is still
    annoyingly manual.
- has formatting, but nowhere obvious in menus, so I turned on auto-formatting
- has "go to definition/declaration"
- can list all the uses of a symbol
- preview for markdown
- Monokai theme
- font selection, enabled ligatures

IOW it has everything I currently need. The mushiness and the clickiness (aka I don't know
the keybindings yet) are a bit painful. Nevertheless, it is good enough. SATISFICING!

## Project setup

- Project management
    - [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html), the one and only
    - [cmake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/guide/tutorial/index.html)
    - [autotools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Autotools), [automake](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/index.html)
- Selected [unit testing frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks#C)
    - [Criterion](https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion), xUnit style, C/C++
    - [Cgreen](https://cgreen-devs.github.io/), BDD style, includes mocks, C++ docs lacking
    - [CuTest](http://cutest.sourceforge.net/), drag and drop two-file framework
- Documentation
    - [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/index.html)
- (not C specific) [git flow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)

Side note: all of the C-specific pages have a distinct late 90's - early 2000's feel. /sigh

These feel like it'd be nice to test-drive them.
