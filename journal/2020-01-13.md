Planned: C refresher.

Book: "Modern C"

## Setup

Had to disable the C/C++ plugin. Found two other useful plugins:

- [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) integration
- [Infer](https://fbinfer.com/) integration

`clang-format` is used by [kernel development community](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/clang-format.html)
and there exists a [.clang-format file in Linux kernel repo](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/.clang-format) 
which I've copied to my repo.

So far, tabs over spaces are annoying, and 8-character-wide tabs are visually
jarring, but I expect I'll get used to it.

## I'm skimming

Today is 100% skim-reading, until I get to the end of part 2. Below, there is
a list of sections to go back to, which I will then re-read and take more
detailed notes from.

- 9.2 naming conventions (note they conflict with macros)
- documentation standard: doxygen - http://www.doxygen.nl/
- A typical header file "brian.h"
- p 128 how to write a macro with a control structure, do-while-false
    and possible pitfalls
- list pointer operations, and why there is ptrdiff_t
- how to print pointers
- don't use NULL
- how to access structures using pointers
- opaque structures
- array parameters are actually pointers: Only the innermost dimension of an array parameter is rewritten
- syntax for declaring a function pointer, creating a pointer to a function
- p 147, encapsulating base functions with void pointer args when performing type conversions
- p 148, how to call a function when you have a pointer to it
- how to use typedef with function pointers
- 151, unsigned char as the base unit
- 12.2 how to declare and initialize a union 
- CHAR_BIT, UCHAR_MAX
- 154, aliasing, effect on optimization
- 156, side effects of pointer conversion (undefined)
- 158, forcing invalid alignment - may be useful/fun for generating crashes
- 5.6.4. compound literals - I skipped that somehow?
- 13.1 - malloc, free etc - list the functions, test using them
- 161 idiom with sizeof *pointer
- 161 idiom with sizeof array
- 165 what to do when malloc fails; how to clean up memory
- 166 realloc
- 167 memcpy vs memmove
- 169 shadowing variables
- 170 storage durations (list)
- p 171 `static` keyword. how to use it?
    - static: lifetime spans the whole program execution
    - table 13.1
-  p 171, `extern` keyword
    - expected to be defined at file scope; probably in another file
    - p 170, linker, library;
    - 13.1
- p 173 `register`
    - important for optimization
- p 174 am I misunderstanding or is this actually very simple
- p 175 VLA lifetime
- p 176 conventions for struct allocation, initialisation
- p 176 macro concatenation, ...
- p 177 and on: how a function translates into assembly, an example
- p 186 snprintf
- 14.2 formatted input (fscanf, scanf, sscanf) - create a table of most useful
specifiers
- p 189, multibyte strings, list functions, don't stress
- 14.4 binary streams, list functions - these files are not portable!
(then what do you do for images?)
- p 197 more error macros
- p 198 errno cleanup
- p 200 goto rules

### Challenges

- Challenge 11 - image processing, identifying common regions
- Challenge 12 - text processor (splitting and merging text blobs)
- Challenge 13 - Generic derivative (followup from challenges 2, 3)
- Challenge 14 - Generic sorting (followup from challenges 1, 10)
- Challenge 15 - string processing, searches, replacements, regexps
- Challenge 16 - text processing in streams
- Challenge 17 - text processor, extend challenge 12 to multibyte characters

### Interesting sections in part 3

- 15.3 (measuring performance)
- 16.6 (type-generic programming)
- 18 (threads)
- 19 (memory consistency)
