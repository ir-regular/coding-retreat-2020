## Haskell! Monads so long

### List monad

Covered elsewhere.

Sorta kinda generators.

### Alternative definition of a monad

Instead of defining `return` and `>>=` you can define `fmap` and `join`

- `fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b`
- `join :: m (m a) -> m a` (flatten)

And then you can redefine:

`x >>= f = join $ fmap f x`

### MonadPlus

Defined in `Control.Monad`

Allows the concept of failure through `mzero`. Eg. for lists, return empty
list. For Maybe, return Nothing.

```haskell
class Monad m => MonadPlus m where
  mzero :: m a
  mplus :: m a -> m a -> m a

-- useful function based on mzero
guard :: MonadPlus m => Bool -> m ()
guard True  = return ()
guard False = mzero

-- use it like so:
do guard bool_condition
   return 1
-- this returns [1] - if inside list monad - iff bool_condition == True

-- Since MonadPlus is similar structurally to Monoid:
msum :: MonadPlus m => [m a] -> m a
-- compare to Monoid
mconcat :: Monoid m => [m] -> m
```

For a Maybe-based MonadPlus, `mplus` acts like `or` in that it short-circuits
on the first non-Nothing. 

### Working on lists inside a monad

These now, reasonably, use Traversable/Foldable rather than list /shrug

- `mapM :: (Traversable t, Monad m) => (a -> m b) -> t a -> m (t b)`
- `mapM_` - doesn't care about returned values, just executing in a context
- `forM`, `forM_` (foreach)
- `sequence :: (Traversable t, Monad m) => t (m a) -> m (t a)`
- `foldM :: (Foldable t, Monad m) => (b -> a -> m b) -> b -> t a -> m b`
- `filterM :: Applicative m => (a -> m Bool) -> [a] -> m [a]`
- `zipWithM`
- `replicateM`

etc

`ap :: Monad m => m (a -> b) -> m a -> m b`

Partial application:

`return compare :: (Monad m, Ord a) => m (a -> a -> Ordering)`

`return compare `ap` x :: (Monad m, Ord a) => m (a -> Ordering)`

```haskell
-- as a rule of thumb, you can replace any call of the form
liftMn f x1 x2 xn
-- by  
return f `ap` x1 `ap` x2 `ap` xn
```

### Logic monad

` Control.Monad.Logic` in `logict` package on Hackage.

By default it behaves like the list monad.

Logic introduces a set of operators that are fair: that is, a set of operators
that do not give priority to any of the possible branches in the computation.

`mplus`, `interleave`, `>>-` (instead of `>>=` - so you need to desugar `do` notation) 

...and a lot more which was not covered.

### Haskell conventions

The Prelude function `undefined` is customarily used as a placeholder for code
that hasnâ€™t been yet written
